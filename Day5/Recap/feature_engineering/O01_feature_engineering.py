# predict Exam success
# Features: hours_studied, has_pencil, minutes_studied, breakfast_eaten
# Target: passed_exam

# 1. hours_studied --> useful! Driectly impacts exam success
# 2. has_pencil --> (0 variance) not useful for prediction (type of feature : quasi-constant)
# 3. minutes_studied ---> redundant (correlated with hours_studied) (100% correlation)
# if minutes_studied is considered , it would be overfitting the model, and introduce multicollinearity, so it should be dropped.
# Does it introduce VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) --> Yes, because it is perfectly correlated with hours_studied
# 4. breakfast_eaten ---> Binary Feature (0 = not eaten or 1 = eaten).
# should it be dropped? --> Not necessarily, it could be useful for prediction depending on the context
# 5. passed_exam --> Target variable (Y), should not be used as a feature for prediction

Main apis used in this script:
- VarianceThreshold from sklearn.feature_selection for removing quasi-constant features
- pandas corr for correlation matrix calculation for removing redundant features due to high correlation
- fit_transform method of VarianceThreshold for applying the variance threshold filtering
- get_support method of VarianceThreshold for retrieving the mask of selected features
